Will be deploying using swarm stack yaml files.

### Installation

1. Navigate to the directory:

    ```
    cd iudx-deployment/Docker-Swarm-deployment/single-node/gis/
    ```

2. Assign the node label if not assigned during swarm installation:

    ```
    docker node update --label-add gis-node=true <node_name>
    ```

3. Make a copy of the sample secrets directory by running the following command:

    ```
    cp -r example-secrets/secrets .
    ```

4. Provide a correct config file for bringing up GIS-server. Substitute appropriate values using commands mentioned in config files.

5. Configure the `.gis.env` file, referring to `example-env`.

6. Define appropriate values of resources:
    - CPU requests and limits
    - RAM requests and limits
    - PID limit

   in `gis-stack.resources.yml` as shown in the sample file **[example-gis-stack.resources.yaml](https://github.com/datakaveri/iudx-deployment/blob/4.5.0/Docker-Swarm-deployment/single-node/gis/example-gis-stack.resources.yaml)**.


7. To install GIS server stack, use the following command:

   ```
   cp example-gis-stack.resources.yaml gis-stack.resources.yaml
   
   docker stack deploy -c gis-stack.yaml -c gis-stack.resources.yaml gis
   ```
