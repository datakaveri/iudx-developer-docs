The resource server proxy is Data Exchange data discovery portal. The consumers can access data from the resource server proxy using HTTPs.

### Installation

1. Navigate to the directory:

    ```bash
    cd iudx-deployment/Docker-Swarm-deployment/single-node/rs-proxy/
    ```

2. Assign node labels
 
    The rs-proxy container is constrained to run on specifc node by adding node labels to only one of the nodes, refer [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/services/#placement-constraints) for more info. This ensures the container is placed always to same node on restart.
    
    ```sh
    docker node update --label-add rs-proxy-node=true <node_name>
    ```

3. Make a copy of sample secrets directory.

    ```console
    cp -r example-secrets/secrets .
    ```
    1. Secrets directory after generation of secret files
    ```sh
    secrets/
    ├── config.json
    └── .rs-proxy.env
    ```

    2. Substitute appropriate values using commands whatever mentioned in config files. Configure the secrets/.rs-proxy.env file with appropriate values in the place holders `<>`

4. Define Appropriate values of resources -

    - CPU of rs-proxy 
    - RAM of rs-proxy
    - PID limit of rs-proxy
    in `rs-proxy-stack.resources.yaml` as shown in sample resource-values file for [here](https://github.com/datakaveri/iudx-deployment/blob/master/Docker-Swarm-deployment/single-node/rs-proxy/example-rs-proxy-stack.resources.yaml)

5. Deploy resource server proxy:
```sh
docker stack deploy -c rs-proxy-stack.yaml -c rs-proxy-stack.resources.yaml rs-proxy
```

### Tests

The apis documentation will be available at 
    `https://<rs-proxy-server-domain-name>/apis`

### Notes

1. The upstream code for resource server is available at [here](https://github.com/datakaveri/iudx-rs-proxy).

2. If you need to expose the HTTP ports or have custom stack configuration( see [here](https://github.com/datakaveri/iudx-deployment/blob/master/Docker-Swarm-deployment/single-node/rs-proxy/example-rs-proxy-stack.custom.yaml) for example configuration of 'rs-proxy-stack.custom.yaml' file)  and bring up like as follows.

```sh
docker stack deploy -c rs-proxy-stack.yaml -c rs-proxy-stack.resources.yaml -c rs-proxy-stack.custom.yaml rs-proxy
```

This is generally useful in local, dev/test environment.
