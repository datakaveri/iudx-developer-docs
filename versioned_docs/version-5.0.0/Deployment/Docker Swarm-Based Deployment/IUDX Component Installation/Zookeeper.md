Before running any API servers or monitoring stack, Zookeeper has to be running.

### Installation

1. Navigate to the directory `iudx-deployment/Docker-Swarm-deployment/single-node/zookeeper/`:

    ```
    cd iudx-deployment/Docker-Swarm-deployment/single-node/zookeeper/
    ```

2. Define appropriate values for resources:
    - CPU requests and limits
    - RAM requests and limits
    - PID limit

    in `zookeeper-stack.resources.yaml` as shown in the sample file **[example-zookeeper-stack.resources.yaml](https://github.com/datakaveri/iudx-deployment/blob/4.5.0/Docker-Swarm-deployment/single-node/zookeeper/example-zookeeper-stack.resources.yaml)**

3. Deploy the Zookeeper stack as follows:

    ```
    cp example-zookeeper-stack.resources.yaml zookeeper-stack.resources.yaml

    docker stack deploy -c zookeeper-stack.yaml -c zookeeper-stack.resources.yaml zookeeper
    ```

### Notes

1. To check if the Zookeeper stacks are deployed and running: `docker stack ps zookeeper`
