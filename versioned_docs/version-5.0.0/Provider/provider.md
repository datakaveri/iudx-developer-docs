# Introduction

The IUDX Auth Provider APIs allow a provider to manage access to the secure resources they own via the [Publisher Panel](https://publisher.iudx.org.in)

## Registration and Provider Approval

The IUDX Admin team will initiate a provider registration by first creating an entry for the provider's organization. A new provider can register with an account when prompted to login at the [Publisher Panel](https://publisher.iudx.org.in). Go to [Registration](../registration.md) for instructions on registering.

**NOTE: Provider registration is subject to approval. A user registered with the provider role may be able to access the Publisher Panel once they have been approved**.
