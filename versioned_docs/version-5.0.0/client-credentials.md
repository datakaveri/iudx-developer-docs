3. The My Profile panel allows you to download your default client credentials or reset your default client credentials in case you have lost them or if they have been compromised.

4. **NOTE : Resetting client credentials will result in revocation of all existing tokens. Additionally, the old client secret will not be accepted in token requests.**
